### Hi there 👋

## About Me
👋I’m Sai Teja Sunku, an aspiring and passionate Computer Scientist and AI Engineer, currently pursuing a BS in Computer Science and an MS in Artificial Intelligence. I thrive on studying and gaining insights into Computer Science foundational principles and the latest AI cutting-edge technologies.  

🎓My journey at Worcester Polytechnic Institute (WPI) has equipped me with a strong foundation in object-oriented design, system programming, operating systems, data structures, algorithms, and web development. Through WPI's project-based learning approach, I've had the opportunity to apply what I have learned to build meaningful and high-quality real-world applications. 

🧑‍💻My growing interest in Web Development and Artificial Intelligence has led me to gain hands-on experience building full-stack web applications using frameworks such as Python Flask, Django, Node.js, and Express. I’ve worked with databases like SQLite and MongoDB and developed responsive frontends using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React. Building these applications has deepened my understanding of web technologies and sharpened my debugging and problem-solving skills. 

🤖In the realm of Artificial Intelligence, I have delved into machine learning, gaining expertise in supervised learning (regression and classification), unsupervised learning (clustering), and time-series modeling. I’ve also explored black box techniques like Random Forest, Decision Trees, and XGBoost. My passion for AI has driven me to explore Generative AI, where I’ve gained insights into concepts such as Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), large language models, LangChain, text chunking, vector embeddings, transformer architecture, and neural networks (including CNNs, GANs, and ANNs). I've also developed skills in natural language processing techniques and prompt engineering. 
 
📈I am a dedicated and quick learner, always eager to grasp new knowledge and stay updated with the latest technological advancements. My commitment to excellence is reflected in my consistent performance, including earning a place on the Dean’s List at WPI. As a hard worker and a collaborative team player, I am determined to contribute meaningfully to any team and strive to make a positive impact through my work. 

*I actively seek opportunities to apply my skills and knowledge in Software Engineering, Web Development, and Artificial Intelligence.*

## My Project Highlights 🧑‍💻:
1. **Chatbot** -
   - Developed chatbot for HR referral policy using RAG pipeline and LangChain, incorporating features such as Chroma, text chunking, prompt templates, and chat message history.
   - Designed bot using Streamlit for user-friendly interface, leveraging OpenAI's text embeddings and GPT-3.5 to generate responses specifically tailored to the policy PDF.
2. **Hospital Management System** -
   - Developed a comprehensive web application for managing hospital databases using Python, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and SQLite.
   - Implemented features for patient and admin functionalities, including registering and booking appointments, updating and deleting patient information, and sending emails and notifications.
   - Structured the application using the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern and applied encapsulation techniques to enhance data security.
3. **Finance Application** -
   - Programmed a web application for managing user financial information, enabling users to add, view, update, and delete financial plans and data.
   - Integrated functionality to generate PDFs of financial data, export data to CSV files, and upload financial documents using Flask framework libraries.
   - Developed dynamic charts (pie, bar, and line) to visualize financial data for the current and previous years, utilizing Pandas and Matplotlib libraries.
   - Built the application using Python, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and SQLite, following the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern for organized and maintainable code.
4. **Billing System** -
   - Developed web application for billing systems to add, view, update, and delete purchase data. The app contains HTML form to manage data entries, display total purchase amount and styled using Bootstrap and custom CSS.
   - Implemented an authentication system for individual users via GitHub, using PassportJS with the GitHub strategy for secure login.
   - Ensured data persistence using MongoDB and Mongoose schemas to handle CRUD operations, specific to the logged-in user ID.
   - Managed data flow between the backend and frontend using the Express framework, JavaScript, and Handlebars, with backend business logic implemented in Node.js.
